# Assignment
This is my first attempt at learning Gherkin and Cucumber.

The "page" being tested is a hypothetical one with multiple non-zero/non-negative values fields and a total balance field which represents the sum of all values (all fields are formatted for currency and have corresponding labels).

# Files Included:
    values.feature: feature file using Gherkin syntax
    values.rb:  attempt to translate values.feature into a steps file (referencing methods in a POM page)
    values_page_object:  mockup of functions being called by values.rb
They represent the approach to testing the page referenced above.


# Effort:
It is a work in progress with about 8 or 9 hours of effort of learning Gherkin/Cucumber and going a little deeper with Ruby.
    
# Ruby:
The role is one that involves Ruby.  As such, Ruby was the language chosen for the steps and page object files.

# Next Steps:
The next steps will involve learning Cucumber and getting tests up and running against actual pages.

A similar page to the one described in the exercise will be located and the three files will be re-done using Java/Cucumber.

The more helpful cucumber tutorials found, for the most part, seemed to use Java.  As such, given more than a 4-8 hour suggested time-frame, these would have been re-written using Java.
