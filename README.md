# Assignment
This is my first attempt at learning Gherkin and Cucumber.

The "page" being tested is a hypothetical one with multiple non-zero and non-negative values fields and a total balance field which represents the sum of all values (all fields have corresponding labels).

# Files Included:
    values.feature: feature file using Gherkin syntax
    values.rb:  attempt to translate values.feature into a steps file (referencing methods in a POM page)
    values_page_object:  mockup of functions being called by values.rb
They represent the approach to testing the page referenced above.


# Effort:
It is a work in progress with about 8 or 9 hours of effort or learning Gherkin/Cucumber and going a little deeper with Ruby.
    
# Ruby:
The requesting company is one that uses Ruby.  As such, Ruby was the language chosen for the steps and page object files.

# Next Steps:
The next steps will involve learning Cucumber and getting cucumber tests up and running.
  
The more helpful cucumber tutorials, for the most part, seemed to use Java.  As such, given more than a 4-8 hour time-frame, these would have been re-written using Java
  
A similar page to the one described in the exercise will be located and the three files will be re-written using Java/Cucumber.
